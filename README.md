Getting Started
---------------

# Preqrequisites #
To perform WiFi-based sensing using WiFiEye, you need
    - A Raspberry PI 4B with Nexmon firmware (see below)
    - A Linux PC or Laptop (e.g., Linux Mint)
      - the GNU C compiler (GCC)
      - GNU make
      - QT library version 5
    - One or multiple standard WiFi APs to create some WiFi signals to capture

# Components #

WiFiEye consists of the following two pieces of software 

1. CSIServer_ng:
    A simple TCP server to be run on the Raspberry PI. 
    It will receive the UDP broadcasts from Nexmon and make them available over the network via TCP port 5501

2. WiFiEye Studio:
    A Qt GUI to display, record and export CSI data in real-time. To be run on any Linux PC from which the Raspberry Pi that runs the CSIServer is reachable over the network. 


# Preparing the Raspberry Pi #

1. Installing Nexmon
   Before using WiFiEye, the Raspberry Pi has to be prepared to run Nexmon firmware patches. For this purpose, configure and run the nexmon CSI tool as describe here:
   [Nexmon CSI Repository](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon_csi for details)

   By default, no RSSI is obtained from this firmware. WiFiEye expects RSSI by default and will hence fail if none is received.
   Therefore, either switch off RSSI processing in networkThread.h by setting the CSI_CONTAINS_RSSI to false:

   #define CSI_CONTAINS_RSSI false

   Alternatively, install a patched version of Nexmon that supports RSSI. This is usually the much better alternative. This works as follows.

   1. Download the following files from
      [here](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon_csi/commit/7e3f9f720e1eb12ef11afd855515981d5a3b715b)
	  (don't clone using git - just download from there)
	  - rc/csi.ucode.b_cm43455c0.7_45_189.patch 
	  - src/csi_extractor.c 
   2. Replace these files in patches/bcm43455c0/7_45_189/nexmon_csi/src of your nexmo installation
   3. Recompile the firmware
      - in your nexmon folder:
      `source setup_env.sh`
      - in /patches/bcm43455c0/7_45_189/nexmon_csi/:
      `make install-firmware`


2. Compiling and running CSIServer_ng

    WiFiEye contains a TCP server to access the CSI data from another computer, which is called CSIServer_ng. It needs to be
    compiled and run. For this purpose, do the follwoing on the Raspberry PI:
    1. Copy te CSIServer_ng folder to the Raspi
    2. In the CSIServer_ng folder, type `make`.
    3. Run the CSI server by the command `./CSIServer`
    4. It is recommended to configure Nexmon and run the CSI Server at startup of the Raspberry Pi.
    We recommend using rc.local. See [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-run-a-raspberry-pi-program-on-startup/method-1-rclocal) for how to do this.
 
3. Compiling and Running WiFiEye Studio
   1. In the folder `WiFiEye`, type `make`
   2. Run WiFiEyeStudio by typing `./wifieye`


# Using WiFiEye Studio #

You can find a good overview on the functionality provided by WiFiEye in our paper. 
When hovering the mouse over some object, a quick description in shown in the status bar.

Here's a quick how-to on using WiFiEye:

1. In the tab _settings->connection_, enter the IP address of hostname of your Raspberry Pi
2. In the tab _visualization_, click _connect_. Upon success, the text in the button will change to "connected" and data is being streamed from the Raspberry Pi
3. In the _visualization tab_, empirically select the range of CSI values in which you can see your events of interest
4. When pressing the _record_ button, the CSI data is stored into a file. The filename can either be selected in the _settings_ tab, or will be automatically assigned based on the time and date. 
   The actual filename is shown in the console when recording starts.
   WiFiEye supports 3 different formats for recording, which can be selected in the _settings_ tab. The actual file format is documented in [doc/fileFormats.pdf](doc/fileFormats.pdf).
5. Real-Time export of the CSI data, e.g., to a classifier, can be initiated in the _Real-Time Classification_ tab. More on this is written below in a separate section.

# Real-Time Export #
WiFiEye can stream the preprocessed CSI data to any external program, e.g., a classifier that uses machine learning methods. 
This is controlled form the _Real-Time Classification_ tab.
Here, any external program can be executed. It is possible to specify the command to be executed and its command line parameters.

The CSI data is written to the standard input of the launched executable. The format is the _Simple CSI format_, which is documented in [doc/fileFormats.pdf](doc/fileFormats.pdf).
The classifier can write its classification results to its standard output, which is imported back into WiFiEye. WiFiEye can annotate these results in the real-time visualization.
Though it can only launch one executable, this executable can run multiple classifier. WiFiEye supports displaying the results of multiple classifiers. Hence, the launched executable needs to launch additional
classifiers, or needs to include multiple of them in one executable. The data fromat for importing results back into WiFiEye is also documented in [doc/fileFormats.pdf](doc/fileFormats.pdf).

A pair of scripts for accessing tensorflow to 1) train  a classifier using previously recorded data and 2) perform live classification using the real-time export mechanism is included in WiFiEye. 
They are described below.

# Building Classification Models using Tensorflow #

The follwoing two python scripts for creating and using a classification model using the Tensorflow machine learning framework are provided along with WiFiEye.
 
 - scripts/model_generation.py:
   This script is used for creating a machine learning model, e.g., for recognizing human activity using CSI data.
   It contains multiple configuration parameters that need to be adjusted in the script. 
 - scripts/realtime_classification.py:
   This script can be executed from with WiFiEye to perform real-time classification. It reads the CSI data in real-time and queries a previously    	
   generated model

Prerequisites
-------------
We recommend Python 3.8. The following python modules need to be installed for these scripts to work.
(The first three are included in Linux Mint, the others need to be installed via pip)
 - matplotlib
 - pandas
 - seaborn
 - tensorflow (type `python3.8 -m pip install tensorflow` in a terminal for installation)
 - imblearn (type `python3.8 -m pip install imblearn` in a terminal for installation)
 
Using model_generation.py
-------------------------
`model_generation.py` provides multiple configurable parameters, which need to be adjusted first.
A (mostly reasonable) default value is assigned to each of them. The parameters to be adjusted can be found under the comment _# Settings_ in the 
script code. The following parameters need to be adjusted:
   - _sampling_frequency_: The sampling frequency of the CSI data, i.e., the (average) number of WiFi frames per second.
   - _seconds_: A time window (in seconds) of CSI data to be fed into the model
   - _overlap_: ? Cristian
   - _training_epochs_: The number of training epochs
   - _time_window_size_: ? Cristian
   - _labels_: An array of strings that contain all labels  
   - _path_to_file_: Path to a file recorded in WiFiEye to be analyzed. It needs to be in the simple CSV format.
 
After adjusting these options, the script needs to be executed repeatedly with different previously recorded CSI files. Different files are specified by changing the _path_to_file_ parameter each time. It is assumed that the data contained in a single CSV file belongs to one specific label. (Cristian, how is the label for each file provided?). Make sure that data is recorded in the *simple* CSV format. The model is stored in a file called `model.h5`. The model stored in this file can be queried using `realtime_classification.py`, which is described next.

Using realtime_classification.py
--------------------------------
`realtime_classification.py` is called from within WiFiEye Studio. This can be done in the 'Real-Time Classification' tab. Use
`python3.8` as the executable and `realtime_classification.py` as the argument. Adjust the number of classes to the length of the _labels_ array in 
 `model_generation.py` (for the default value in the script, this would be 4). 
 The script will assign a counting number to the sting lables, which are imported back into WiFiEye. E.g., the first label in the _labels_ string of
 `model_generation.py` will be _0_, the second one _1_, the third one _2_,... 

After `realtime_classification.py` has been executed, the _Classifier Output_ plot will be available in WiFiEye Studio and in sync with the CSI data.

# Developing Plugins #
WiFiEye supports plugins to process CSI data. A plugin is a simple C-file. It is complied independently from WiFiEye. 
Developing filter plugins is simple and can be learned within minutes. A filter plugin has to provide a couple of functions, which are being called trough WiFiEye using dynamic linking.

The only code a plugin needs to import from WiFiEye is the structure _CSIData_ from [studio/src/CSIData.h](studio/src/CSIData.h).
A function called _filter_run()_ obtains a pointer to a filled _CSIData_ structure. The processing plugin can modify the data in this structure. WiFiEye studio will read the changes back after _filter_run()_ has finished.

Learning how a filter is written can be done by examining the extensively commented file [studio/src/filters/sample_filter.c](studio/src/filters/sample_filter.c).
This file implements a fully-functional sample filter with minimalistic code effort. Each function that is  contains a detailed description as a comment. It can also serfe as a sceleton for writing a custom filter.
With [studio/src/filters/sample_filter.c](studio/src/filters/sample_filter.c), it is straight-forward two develop a custom plugin - no additional documentation needed.

# Developing for WiFiEye studio #
If you want to modify or extend WiFiEyeStudio, you find a full Doxygen documentation of all files of WiFiEye Studio in the [doc](doc) subdirecory.
To build this documentation, go to the _doc/_ subdirectory. Then type _doxygen_ for building the documentation. Next, go to the _doc/latex/_ subdirectory and type _make_ to compile a PDF document.
Next, you find a documentation in the file _doc/latex/refman.pdf_.

Please also let us know if you'd like to contribute some code to our repository.
